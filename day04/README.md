## First star

Two dimensional array search! This is a classic.
I've been super verbose and created eight different functions to search in any direction, this can be
cleaned up **a lot**, but this is AoC first; and second, having separated code might (or might not) help in part 2.

## Second star

Loved the wording of the second star. The elf looks at you. Can you even read? he thinks.
I could remove most of the code of part 1 but reuse the general idea. This is actually very simple to solve if you are clever.
