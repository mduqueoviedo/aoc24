# Advent of Code 2024

My humble submission to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

### ðŸŽ„ ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ„ ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ„ **Merry Christmas and happy coding!!!** ðŸŽ„ ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ„ ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ„

If you stumble here, let me give you a piece of advice :)

Some people don't want to share they are participating in AOC, precisely because other fellow devs say stuff of the sort of _"If you are having trouble with this or that AOC challenge, you are not a good developer!"_.

**Please.** Do us all a favour and don't be that person.

PS: If I were to listen to that, I can tell you I am not a good developer either. Join my club!
