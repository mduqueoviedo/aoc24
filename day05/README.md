## First star

Too verbose and repeated code >\_< But I have to say it worked at the first try :D

## Second star

I am impressed of how horrible this code looks. I am just reusing a bit of the logic of the previous one, and have not complicated too much on the sorting according the rules. I added a while loop, then whenever a sorting rule was wrong, I flipped those two elements. Rinse and repeat. It actually worked!
