## First star

This is way more difficult to understand than it is to implement. A lot of looping, but calculating the position of the antinodes is very simple. No actual need of grid manipulation apart from the initial reading of antennas.

## Second star

This one, so far I don't understand LOL

Ok, this was confusing. I didn't understand the text at all, but I see in the examples that the antinodes repeat themselves until they go out of bounds. And additionally, the antennas now count as antinodes. Star 1 code worked perfectly with the additions and a lot of repetition because I don't want to lose too much time :D
