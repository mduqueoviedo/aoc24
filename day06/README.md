## First star

This time we have a grid but we have to move through it. When we have this kind of problem I think breaking it in as many tiny functions will work now and most likely the second star as well.

## Second star

The problem in second star is trying to reduce loops and shorting them as much as possible, because otherwise execution will take too long for memory to work. We only need to put obstacles in places the guard will go through, this saves a lot already. And careful not to store repeated positions!
Definitely the aux functions from star 1 helped a lot.
